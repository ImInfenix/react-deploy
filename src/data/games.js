      'The Never Too late Program was made for the Blackthornprod Jam 3, with the theme "Less is More". In this game, you work in a factory where you have to carry objects from one point to another. Each day, there is a goal to reach, but be careful ! If you are too fast, you will have more work to do which may lead to failing to reach the new goal. The sounds and music are from Pierre Bédue. This game was made with Unity, Blender, Aseprite, Cubase and Audacity.',

      "Tower Forge is a tower defense I made in collaboration withJohan Poncet. In Tower Forge, you play as dwarves defending their city against an alien invasion. The way the game differs from others tower defense games is that you can build the towers the way you want, choosing the combination of base/weapon each tower is going to use. It is up to the player to choose what element will go well with the others to make sure no alien will get through his defenses. The music is fromPierre Bédue. This game is available on the itch.io website and was developed using Unity, Photoshop, Cubase and Audacity.",

      'On January 2020, the second ESIR Game Jam (my engineering school) was organized. This Game Jam\'s theme was "Safe In the Dark". With my group made of four people including another programmer, we decided to make a two local player game where the first player is trying to escape from a prison. The second player helps him in achieving this goal after becoming "Shadow", an entity able to hide every source of light and deactivating it. 2045 was made in 35 hours using Unity, Photoshop and Audacity.',

I was the only programmer on the team as the three other were digital artists students. In Pop-Up Run, you have to find your way through the Internet with a runner-like gameplay while ads keep coming to cover your screen. You have to close enough ads to open the end of the game where you can finally be at peace. But be careful ! If you click on ads instead of closing theme, more ads will be coming !
